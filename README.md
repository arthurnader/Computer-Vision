# Computer Vision

This repository contains a collection of Computer Vision projects. These projects cover a wide range of topics, including convolutional neural networks, image compressing, augmented reality, tracking and so on.

## Augmented reality
This was the most challenging but exciting project I have done in Computer Vision. The steps involved include calibrate the camera to obtain its intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, detect a target, and then, using a pose estimation algorithm, render a Pikachu over the target.

## Tracking
In this project, I used tracking algorithms to detect an object in the first frame of a video and follow it through subsequent frames.

## Captcha Solver
Using convolutional neural networks, this project aims to automatically solve CAPTCHA challenges by recognizing and deciphering distorted text.

## Image compressing
This project focuses on image compression, reducing file sizes without significantly compromising visual quality. To evaluate the compression, metrics such as compression rate, PSNR, and RMSE were used.


## Computer Vision Scraper
This is a conceptual project aimed at large-scale data collection using Computer Vision. The idea is based on the observation that button templates often repeat across various websites, allowing for the creation of a
